Kuorinka Plus is add-on plugin for [Kuorinka WordPress Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/kuorinka/).

## Commercial Plugin

Kuorinka Plus is a commercial Plugin available in my site [Foxland](https://foxland.fi/downloads/kuorinka/). The plugin is hosted here
on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike.
If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, you can submit it here.

If you are using the plugin on a live site it would be cool that you purchase a valid license from [Plugin page](https://foxland.fi/downloads/kuorinka/).
After that you get support and automatic updates.
